    Amazon Price Checker

   <h1>Hands on: computing prices for Amazon</h1> 

    <p>Create a web page: "Amazon Price Generator"
Use prompt( )to ask a few questions:
What is the name of the item?  Base price?  (before markup/markdown)
Is today "Black Friday"?  Did the purchaser find the product through a search engine?  Did purchaser visit a comparison-shopping site?
Add logic & concatenate strings to alert "The base price for [item] is $[basePrice]. We will increase the price by 1% to pay the search engine. The purchaser shopped other sites, so we will reduce the price by 
10% to get their business. We will reduce the price by 25% 
since it's Black Friday.  The final price is $[finalPrice]."</p>
